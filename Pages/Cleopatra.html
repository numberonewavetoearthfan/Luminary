            <h2>About Cleopatra VII</h2>
            <ul>
                <p> The oldest child of King Ptolemy XII Auletes, Cleopatra was the last queen of the Macedonian dynasty that ruled Egypt between 323 and 30 bc. Alexander the Great’s general Ptolemy, who became King Ptolemy I Soter, founded the dynasty of Ptolemaic rulers. Upon her father’s death Cleopatra, then aged 18, inherited the throne alongside her younger brother Ptolemy XIII. At first Cleopatra served as the dominant ruler.Cleopatra was deeply loved by her people, often described as patriotic and intelligent, with ancient Egyptian texts referring to her as "Philopatris," meaning "she who loves her country." While not conventionally beautiful, she captivated others with her charm, wit, and political acumen. Cleopatra's brilliance lay in her ability to adapt and reinvent herself for political advantage. During her reign, Rome's growing dominance over Egypt became evident. Although Egypt remained wealthy, the Ptolemaic dynasty relied heavily on Rome's support. Following the death of Cleopatra's father, the Roman leader Pompey was tasked with overseeing her and her brother to ensure Egypt's tributes to Rome were maintained. Cleopatra fled Egypt in 50 BC after her brother Ptolemy XIII seized power. She gathered troops in Syria and returned to challenge him but initially failed. In 48 BC, she allied with Julius Caesar, becoming his lover and using his influence to reclaim the throne. Ptolemy XIII drowned in the Nile, and Cleopatra, now married to her younger brother Ptolemy XIV, gave birth to a son, Caesarion, implying Caesar was the father. Cleopatra visited Rome but returned to Egypt after Caesar’s assassination in 44 BC.</p>

            <h2 id="Early">Background</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator, born around 69 B.C., was the last ruler of the Macedonian dynasty in Egypt. This dynasty began in 323 B.C., after Alexander the Great's death, when his general Ptolemy became King Ptolemy I Soter. Over three centuries, Ptolemaic Egypt became a significant world power.Cleopatra's father was King Ptolemy XII, while her mother's identity is less certain, with some believing she was Cleopatra V Tryphaena, her father's sister. There is also debate about Cleopatra's ethnicity, with suggestions that she might have had partial Black African ancestry.Little is known of Cleopatra’s childhood, except that she was being groomed as the future leader of the country. Unlike the rest of her family, Cleopatra took great interest in Egyptian history and religion. She was the only member of her family to learn the Egyptian language. Cleopatra became co-ruler of Egypt at the death of her father in 51 BC. Egyptian law forced her to share her new role as pharaoh with Ptolemy XIII, her younger brother. In fact, she would never be the sole ruler of Egypt in name, sharing the official title with her brothers and her son.</p>
